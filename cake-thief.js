low capacity, large cakes: no solution

high capacity, one type of cake: fill the bag with what i can fit
f([(5, 20)], 20): 80

high capacity, one type of cake, remainder: fill the bag

high capacity, two types of cake, remainder filled by second type: fill the bag

if capacity is a multiple of the most valuable type of cake, use that cake


first subproblem:
* find cake values
* are certain cakes ever worth it?
* is it a multiple of the most valuable type of cake? if so, fill the bag with that.
* can we fill the remainder with smaller cake?

capacity = 20

KNOWNS:
* cakeValue
* cakeWeight
* duffelCapacity
* cakeValueByWeight
